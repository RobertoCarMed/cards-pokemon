# cards-pokemon
In this repo you can find a pokedex. This application gets twenty pokemons from an API and displays them on the screen. The root path shows a random pokemon, but you can see the complete list of the twenty pokemon and see more information about each pokemon. All the information on this page is obtained from the API: https://pokeapi.co/
